# CiviCRM-Sympa Syncronization (org.civicrm.sympasync)

[CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/) is a CRM suite for non-profit organizations. 
[Sympa](http://www.sympa.org/) is a mailing list application which allows
subscribers to exchange messages.  With the `org.civicrm.sympasync` extension,
you can manage subscribers in CiviCRM while using Sympa's mailing list.

Most of the integration is handled by Sympa using [dynamic mailing
lists](http://www.sympa.org/manual/managing-members). The extension provides
instructions and utilities which help with integration.

To get started, install the extension in CiviCRM and navigate to
"Administer: Communications: Sympa Sync".
